## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I chose the world-renowned painting "The Scream" as the original component for my re-creation.

1. Bacground Item
I want to transform the background of the shouting scene into a series of flowing lines. As time goes by, the lines gradually fill in the white space from the periphery of the picture towards the center, resembling a flowing river.

2. Characters Appear Item
After the background was completed, the screaming little figure appeared in the center of the screen.

3. Characters Interaction Item
The screaming little figure transforms into a composition of several blocks. When clicked with the mouse, there will be a collision effect that causes the blocks to explode.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I explored two p5.js techniques to recreate dynamic visual effects. The first uses Perlin noise to move particles in organic, flowing paths—ideal for simulating “The Scream”’s swirling background. The second uses image-based particle systems with interactive triggers, enabling elements to explode or reassemble when clicked.

Together, they support emotional motion and interactive disruption in my re-creation.
